# Phase 2 Testing and Validation Guide

## 1. Dataset Selection
Selecting the appropriate datasets is crucial for effective testing. Review the following considerations:
- Identify critical datasets that are used in your reports.
- Ensure datasets are representative of real-world usage.
- Validate that datasets are configured correctly in the testing environment.

## 2. OAuth Testing
Testing OAuth authentication is vital to ensure that users can authenticate successfully.
- Conduct tests using different user accounts to validate access control.
- Verify token expiration and refresh flow.
- Ensure error handling works properly in case of authentication failures.

## 3. Migration Testing
Testing the migration process is necessary to validate that data transfers correctly.
- Use sample datasets to validate migration steps.
- Check data integrity post-migration by comparing source and target datasets.
- Document any discrepancies and investigate their causes.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Errors
During testing, common errors may arise. Follow these steps for troubleshooting:
- Review error logs for detailed messages.
- Verify configurations against the documentation.
- Ensure network connectivity for external data sources.

## 5. User Validation Checklists
A user validation checklist helps ensure that users can access what they need post-migration:
- Confirm access to migrated datasets.
- Validate report functionality and data accuracy.
- Gather user feedback for improvement.
